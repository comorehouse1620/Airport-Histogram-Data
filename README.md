# **Lab5: Analyzing Airport Data**


### What you will submit:

Description: This lab takes data regarding the locations of international airports and flight routes and creates an output of a histogram
that visualizes the frequency of distances for international flights. The inputs of this lab are Airport.dat, Routes.dat, camp_stats.csv. The outputs are Airports for a specific country, a dictionary of Airport IDS and latitude, a dictionary of Airport IDS and longitude, a list of route
distances, a histogram that visualizes those distances. 

The final output is below:

A link to your Github repo. The repo must contain your Python code (either as script in `.py` or a notebook in `.ipynb` format). There are four code challenges here, so be sure your code is well documented and shows us how you are solving each challenge! The `README` of your repo should briefly summarize the project (in your own words) and contain an embdded image of your final output. You do not need to include the data files you downloaded (as I have here), but can if you like. If you're going to use this repo as part of your portfolio I suggest that you include a "data" section in your readme that explains what data you've used and links to the pages where it can be downloaded (in fact, you can just copy that text from this repo!).


## Data 
Data is found at [OpenFlights project](https://openflights.org/). Visit the [OpenFlights data page](https://openflights.org/data.html) and download their airports data file - “airports.dat”. This is a file in CSV format, open it in a text editor if you want to have a look at it. If, for some reason, you can't access the OpenFlights page or download the data, there is an [archived data set in the data folder of this tutorial](data/airports.dat).
