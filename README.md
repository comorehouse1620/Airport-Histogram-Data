distances, a histogram that visualizes those distances.

## Data 
Data is found at [OpenFlights project](https://openflights.org/). Visit the [OpenFlights data page](https://openflights.org/data.html) and download their airports data file - “airports.dat”. This is a file in CSV format, open it in a text editor if you want to have a look at it. If, for some reason, you can't access the OpenFlights page or download the data, there is an [archived data set in the data folder of this tutorial](data/airports.dat).
